      "After the birth of our daughter Amy in 1987 we found there was little time to prepare the wholesome nutritious food we normally ate. Realizing there were others like ourselves, we set up up Amy's Kitchen to produce delicious, nourishing frozen meals for health-conscious people too busy to cook.We use only the finest natural and organic ingredients and prepare them with the same careful attention in our kitchen as you would in your own home. No meat, fish, shellfish, poultry, eggs or peanuts are ever used in any Amy's products.For those who want a really great tasting cheese pizza or prefer to add their own favorite toppings. The light, tender crust made from organic wheat flour and extra virgin olive oil is prebaked and then covered with just the right amount of our savory organic tomato pizza sauce and grated mozzarella cheese. A sure favorite with kids.For variety you'll  also want to try our other single serve pizzas: Margherita Pizza, Pesto Pizza and Light In Sodium Spinach Pizza.Pizza is always popular. But there are times when a full-sized pizza is too much to prepare and certainly too much for one person to eat. That''s why we've created Amy's individual-sized Single Serve Pizzas, which have the same great taste and natural and organic ingredients as our full-sized pizzas. They are just right for one person to eat for a quick lunch or a tasty snack!0g trans fat.No added msg.No preservatives.No GMOs - No bioengineered ingredients.All dairy ingredients are made with pasteurized, rBST hormone free milk and do not contain animal enzymes or animal rennet.Certified Organic by QAI.Carton is made from 100% recycled paperboard.

      "Back in 1986, the buzz on the south side of Chicago was all about the hand-made pizza served at a small one-table pizzeria named \"Doreen's\".

Quite an accomplishment for a town as famous for its pizza as Chicago!

      "The Legend Continues! When the winning run from a neighborhood baseball game shattered the front window of their newly purchased tavern, Mary and Vincent Grittani decided to name their new establishment Home Run Inn. That was 1923. From then, until the late 1940's, their business remained a small neighborhood bar where Vincent served the drinks while Mary prepared noon meals. In 1942, a fellow named Nick Perrino married Vincent and Mary's daughter, Loretta Grittani. Like the rest of the thousands of World War II soldiers, who returned to civilian life, Nick was searching for a way to support his family. In 1947, Nick formed a partnership with his mother-in-law, Mary Grittani, and together they developed the recipe for Home Run Inn pizza as we know it today. The family's determination, hard work, and the pride they felt in serving a quality product has brought Home Run Inn from a small corner pizzeria, to a legendary pizza business. Due to growing demand for the unique taste of Home Run Inn pizza, in the late 1950's Home Run Inn expanded into the distribution of frozen pizza. Over the decades the family opened new pizzerias and in 1987 built their first USDA plant in response to the growing demand for their pizza. Today, Home Run Inn continues as a family run business staying true to the original pizza recipe using only the finest ingredients when making their legendary frozen pizza. Joe Perrino - CEO. Did You Know... - Home Run Inn frozen pizzas are made using the same recipe and fresh ingredients as our pizzeria pizzas. - At www.HomeRunInn.com, you can find nutritional information and discover ways to customize your pizza. - Home Run Inn was one of the first frozen pizzas distributed in the United States.

Sauce: Our sauce is made in small batches and has been inspired by our founders to provide you with the taste from the old country.

      "After the birth of our daughter Amy in 1987 we found there was little time to prepare the wholesome nutritious food we normally ate. Realizing there were others like ourselves, we set up Amy's Kitchen to produce delicious, nourishing frozen meals for health-conscious people too busy to cook. We use only the finest natural and organic ingredients and prepare them with the same careful attention in our kitchen as you would in your own home. No meat, fish, shellfish, poultry, eggs or peanuts are ever used in any Amy's products. Amy's Cheese Pizza Snacks give you all the fun and flavor of pizza without the hassle of preparation and serving. They're easy to hold and easy to eat! Inside the light tender organic crust you'll find a delicious filling - Amy's own organic pizza sauce and reduced fat mozzarella cheese. And of course - kids love 'em! Recently we were planning the menu for a friend's 30th anniversary celebration and couldn't figure out what to serve as hors d'oeuvres. Amy's dad came up with a great idea. Why not serve snack sized versions of our popular pocket sandwiches? We did and everyone loved them, so now we're making them available to you. Amy's Snacks... quick and easy to prepare, handy to hold and absolutely delicious. Serve them to your guests or take some along the next time you're invited to a gathering and asked to \"bring snacks.\" They're sure to be a hit. Cheese pizza snacks. 0g trans fat. No added MSG.

      "We love to cook for you, especially those of you who challenge us to create wonderful options for special diets. Amy's vegan margherita pizza with Daiya??? Cheeze satisfies all of our customers without sacrificing any of the best components of a pizza: an excellent crust, a savory pizza sauce, and flavorful toppings. We begin with a thinner hand-stretched wheat crust, diced tomatoes and a balanced sauce of sun-ripened tomatoes, classic Italian seasonings and fragrant basil. What makes this pizza unique is our use of Daiya's shredded mozzarella-style cheese alternative, which is free of cholesterol, lactose and other common allergens but full of flavor. It stretches and melts and tastes like the real thing. This is a pizza that provides our vegan and dairy-free customers with a familiar cheese pizza experience and it's one that everyone will love. Everyone in our family loves pizza: for dinner, lunch, snacks, parties-even for breakfast. And everyone has a favorite. Amy's uncle bill ran a landmark pizzeria in California and helped develop recipes for our earliest pizzas. Since then, we've been inspired by ideas from our community of chefs, employees and customers to make better and more diverse pizzas. We love that it's a comfort food you can share and make memories around our vegan margherita pizza with Daiya Cheeze??? is a delicious vegan and dairy-free take on a classic and is sure to bring your friends and families together. For variety you'll also want to try our soy cheese pizza, roasted vegetable pizza and rice crust spinach pizza. 0g trans fat. No added MSG. No preservatives.

This makes it difficult to know how safe these colorings are, since you do not know exactly what you are consuming. The FDA is wise not to make a distinction, however, because the process of extracting natural colors is <i>far</i> from natural and these substances are not necessarily safer!',

      "No one ever said it would be easy... Going Against The Grain. And, no one understands more than we do, the challenges of delivering delicious gluten free products in a world of industrialized food. There was a time when food was hand-crafted at home from simple, farm-fresh ingredients and eaten with respect. Somewhere along the way, the people were taken out of food production, and then the real ingredients themselves. Food chemists invented flavor enhancers, dough conditioners, binders, preservatives, and modified basic food starches beyond recognition. Something as sacred as a cheese-topped pizza was transformed from comfort food into a chemistry experiment. Here at Against The Grain, we sincerely believe that you are what you eat. Our milk comes from a local family farm that bottles the milk less than 24 hours before we receive it. Our eggs are delivered directly from the hens to us by a local family egg farm - you can't find them any fresher. We use expeller-pressed non-GMO canola oil and low fat mozzarella cheese made from the milk of dairy cows that are routinely veterinarian inspected. Our cheese has no added growth hormones, no anti-caking agents, and is natamycin-free. We never use any binders, dough conditioners, flavor enhancers, stabilizers, or preservatives. In fact, you can pronounce and spell all of our ingredients! No preservatives, dough conditioners, gums, or flavor enhancers are ever used in any of our products. Try other Against The Grain gourmet products: Pepperoni pizza. Pumpermickle rolls. Three cheese pizza. Sesame bagels. Original baguettes. Sun-dried tomato basil bagels. Rosemary baguettes. 12-inch pizza shell. Original rolls. Dairy free cinnamon raisin bagels. Rosemary rolls. Dairy free Vermont country rolls. Who is Against The Grain? We're a family-owned commercial bakery located in one of the coolest towns in the United States - Brattleboro, Vermont. On the banks of the Connecticut river, we bake all-natural artisan breads, pizza shells, and pizzas in a 22,000 square foot dedicated gluten free facility. Our products contain no gluten, wheat, corn, soy, rice, sugar, yeast, peanuts, or tree nuts. We believe strongly in supporting our local economy as well as providing livable wages. We provide employment opportunities for people with disabilities. We sponsor Strolling of the Heifers www.strollingoftheheifers.com. We give all our bloopers to local food shelters. \"When the gods wish to punish us, they answer our prayers.\" Oscar Wilde. If you obey all the rules, you miss all the fun. Katharine Hepburn.

No artificial colors, flavors or preservatives. Contains bioengineered food ingredients. All natural (Minimally processed, no artificial ingredients): No artificial colors, flavors or preservatives.��� Great taste from restaurant quality ingredients Est 1963. Taste the tradition! Our crust is thin, tender and dusted with corn meal for an added depth of flavor. Our signature sauce is a family recipe that has been passed down for generations. We start with robust tomatoes, then add a blend of select herbs to create a smooth, flavorful sauce. Our premium quality toppings are a delicious combination of oven roasted green peppers, onions, black olives, uncured pepperoni (No added nitrate or nitrites except those naturally occurring in sea salt and celery juice powder) and pork Italian sausage that is topped with our signature blend of creamy 100% real mozzarella, Parmesan, and Romano cheeses. Our Connie's Story: Always experimenting, never satisfied - these have been the hallmarks of my father's approach to pizza to pizza making since he first traded his prized 1962 Oldsmobile Starfire for a small storefront pizzeria in 1963. For the next 50 years, this drive and philosophy resulted in hundreds of innovations and the continued growth of Connie's. Everything from our drive-thru pizza pickup to those famous heated delivery trucks, Connie's Pizza became a Chicago Icon with its restaurants, concessions, and catering businesses. When Dad specially formulated a frozen pizza designed to go from our kitchen to your table with the same outstanding quality as our restaurants - i knew we had something special. Today as a son of a pizza man, I'm proud to present our classic thin crust pizza. Pride in our product. Product in our name. Try our newest creation and taste the tradition. The Connie's Guarantee. We guarantee you will love our pizza or we will give you a replacement. Please keep the enjoy by date information and the register receipt as proof of purchase.
